<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `apply_type` (String) Recommendation apply type. IMMEDIATE - pods are restarted immediately when new recommendation is generated. DEFERRED - pods are not restarted and recommendation values are applied during natural restarts only (new deployment, etc.)
- `cluster_id` (String) CAST AI cluster id
- `cpu` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cpu))
- `management_option` (String) Defines possible options for workload management. READ_ONLY - workload watched (metrics collected), but no actions performed by CAST AI. MANAGED - workload watched (metrics collected), CAST AI may perform actions on the workload.
- `memory` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--memory))
- `name` (String) Scaling policy name

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

- `args` (List of String)
- `function` (String) The function used to calculate the resource recommendation
- `overhead` (Number) Overhead for the recommendation, the formula is: (1 + overhead) * function(args).
