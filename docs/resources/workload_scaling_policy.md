# castai_workload_scaling_policy (Resource)

Manage workload scaling policy. Scaling policy [reference](https://docs.cast.ai/docs/woop-scaling-policies)

Scaling policies allow you to manage all your workloads centrally. You can apply the same settings to multiple workloads
simultaneously or create custom policies with different settings and apply them to multiple workloads.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "castai_workload_scaling_policy" "services" {
  name              = "services"
  cluster_id        = castai_gke_cluster.dev.id
  apply_type        = "IMMEDIATE"
  management_option = "MANAGED"
  assignment_rules {
    rules {
      namespace {
        names = ["default", "kube-system"]
      }
    }
    rules {
      workload {
        gvk = ["Deployment", "StatefulSet"]
        labels_expressions {
          key      = "region"
          operator = "NotIn"
          values   = ["eu-west-1", "eu-west-2"]
        }
        labels_expressions {
          key      = "helm.sh/chart"
          operator = "Exists"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cpu {
    function = "QUANTILE"
    overhead = 0.15
    apply_threshold_strategy {
      type       = "PERCENTAGE"
      percentage = 0.1
    }
    args                     = ["0.9"]
    look_back_period_seconds = 172800
    min                      = 0.1
    max                      = 1
  }
  memory {
    function = "MAX"
    overhead = 0.35
    apply_threshold_strategy {
      type = "DEFAULT_ADAPTIVE"
    }
    limit {
      type       = "MULTIPLIER"
      multiplier = 1.5
    }
    management_option = "READ_ONLY"
  }
  startup {
    period_seconds = 240
  }
  downscaling {
    apply_type = "DEFERRED"
  }
  memory_event {
    apply_type = "IMMEDIATE"
  }
  anti_affinity {
    consider_anti_affinity = false
  }
  confidence {
    threshold = 0.9
  }
}
```

## Importing

For each connected cluster, a default scaling policy is created. An existing scaling policy can be imported into the
Terraform state using the `terraform import` command or the [`import`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import#syntax) block (recommended for Terraform 1.5.0+).

Using the `import` block is a simpler and more convenient way of importing resources.

### Import using `import` block

#### Import a single scaling policy

1. Create an `import.tf` file with the following content:
   ```tf
   import {
   	 to       = castai_workload_scaling_policy.default
   	 id       = "<cluster_id>/<policy_id_or_name>" # e.g. "ff4c2211-3511-4d95-b6de-2919fc3287a3/default"
   }
   ```

2. Run the `terraform import` command:

   ```shell
   terraform plan -out=import.plan -var-file=tf.vars -generate-config-out=generated.tf
   ```

3. Review the `generated.tf` file and ensure the imported scaling policy is correct. Terraform will generate this file by setting values equal to zero for certain configuration parameters.

   For example:

   ```hcl
   cpu {
     look_back_period_seconds = 0
   }

4. Apply the import plan:

   ```shell
   terraform apply "import.plan"
   ```

#### Import multiple scaling policies

To import multiple scaling policies, you need to know the cluster IDs and the policy names. The `for_each` cannot be
used when generating configuration. As a result, you need to define the policy properties yourself, or you
can [import a single policy](#import-a-single-scaling-policy) and then use it as a template for other policies.

> [!NOTE]
> The below example assumes that you want to import the "default" scaling policy for multiple clusters. If you want to
> import
> scaling policies with different names, you need to adjust the `id` parameter in the `import` block accordingly.

1. Create the `import.tf` file with the following content:

   ```tf
   locals {
   	 policies = {
   		 "<cluster_name>" = "<cluster_id>"
   		 "<cluster_name>" = "<cluster_id>"
   		 "<cluster_name>" = "<cluster_id>"
   	 }
   }

   import {
   	 for_each = local.policies
   	 to       = castai_workload_scaling_policy.default[each.key]
   	 id       = "${each.value}/default"
   }

   resource "castai_workload_scaling_policy" "default" {
   	 for_each          = local.policies
   	 cluster_id        = each.value
   	 apply_type        = "IMMEDIATE"
   	 management_option = "READ_ONLY"
   	 name              = "default"
   	 cpu {
   		 apply_threshold          = 0.1
   		 args = ["0.80"]
   		 function                 = "QUANTILE"
   		 look_back_period_seconds = 86400
   		 min                      = 0.01
   	 }
   	 memory {
   		 apply_threshold          = 0.1
   		 args = []
   		 function                 = "MAX"
   		 look_back_period_seconds = 86400
   		 min                      = 10
   		 overhead                 = 0.1
   	 }
   }
   ```

2. Run the `terraform import` command and review the import plan:

   ```shell
   terraform plan -out=import.plan -var-file=tf.vars
   ```

3. Apply the import plan:

   ```shell
   terraform apply "import.plan"
   ```

### Import using the `terraform import` command

You can use the `terraform import` command to import existing scaling policy to Terraform state.

To import a resource, first write a resource block for it in your configuration, establishing the name by which
it will be known to Terraform:

```hcl
resource "castai_workload_scaling_policy" "services" {
  # ...
}
```

Now terraform import can be run to attach an existing scaling policy to this resource:
```shell
$ terraform import castai_workload_scaling_policy.services <cluster_id>/services
```

If you are using CAST AI Terraform modules, import command will be slightly different:
```shell
$ terraform import 'module.castai-eks-cluster.castai_workload_scaling_policy.this["services"]' <cluster_id>/services
```

## Upsert scaling policy

The recommended way is to [import](#importing) the scaling policy and then apply the changes to the policy.
However, if thatâ€™s not possible, you can define the default policy resource yourself. The CAST AI Terraform provider
will update the existing policy instead of returning an error.
