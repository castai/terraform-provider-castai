# castai_rebalancing_schedule (Resource)

CAST AI rebalancing schedule resource to manage rebalancing schedules.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "castai_rebalancing_schedule" "spots" {
	name = "rebalance spots at every 30th minute"
	schedule {
		cron = "*/30 * * * *"
	}
	trigger_conditions {
		savings_percentage = 20
	}
	launch_configuration {
		# only consider instances older than 5 minutes
		node_ttl_seconds = 300
		num_targeted_nodes = 3
		rebalancing_min_nodes = 2
		evict_gracefully = false
		selector = jsonencode({
			nodeSelectorTerms = [{
				matchExpressions = [
					{
						key =  "scheduling.cast.ai/spot"
						operator = "Exists"
					}
				]
			}]
		})
		execution_conditions {
			enabled = true
			achieved_savings_percentage = 10
		}
	}
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `launch_configuration` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--launch_configuration))
- `name` (String) Name of the schedule.
- `schedule` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--schedule))
- `trigger_conditions` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--trigger_conditions))

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--launch_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `launch_configuration`

Optional:

- `evict_gracefully` (Boolean) Defines whether the nodes that failed to get drained until a predefined timeout, will be kept with a rebalancing.cast.ai/status=drain-failed annotation instead of forcefully drained.
- `execution_conditions` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--launch_configuration--execution_conditions))
- `node_ttl_seconds` (Number) Specifies amount of time since node creation before the node is allowed to be considered for automated rebalancing.
- `num_targeted_nodes` (Number) Maximum number of nodes that will be selected for rebalancing.
- `rebalancing_min_nodes` (Number) Minimum number of nodes that should be kept in the cluster after rebalancing.
- `selector` (String) Node selector in JSON format.

<a id="nestedblock--launch_configuration--execution_conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `launch_configuration.execution_conditions`

Required:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enables or disables the execution conditions.

Optional:

- `achieved_savings_percentage` (Number) The percentage of the predicted savings that must be achieved in order to fully execute the plan.If the savings are not achieved after creating the new nodes, the plan will fail and delete the created nodes.



<a id="nestedblock--schedule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `schedule`

Required:

- `cron` (String) Cron expression defining when the schedule should trigger.


<a id="nestedblock--trigger_conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `trigger_conditions`

Required:

- `savings_percentage` (Number) Defines the minimum percentage of savings expected.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Associate terraform resource "spots" with a rebalancing schedule named "spots".
terraform import 'castai_rebalancing_schedule.spots' spots

# Importing via direct schedule ID is also possible.
terraform import 'castai_rebalancing_schedule.spots' b4e69e0c-1762-45eb-bd4f-85cb172e6ad3
```
